A website that looks like a terminal  

This is how [sharkfood.com](https://sharkfood.com) is built atm.  
To edit with your own content, edit `content.json`.  
To compile, install typescript (`npm install -g typescript`) and then run `tsc` at the project root.  
Elements include `text`, `image`, `link`, `selection` ,`input` and `button`.  
See `main.ts` for how to use, it is dead simple.   
Enjoy!
